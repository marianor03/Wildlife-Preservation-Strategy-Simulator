# 🐾 Wildlife Preservation Strategy Simulator

A Python-based conservation strategy game inspired by Tic-Tac-Toe. The project simulates decision-making between a conservationist (player) and environmental threats (AI), helping users understand ecological challenges through strategic gameplay.

## 🎯 Overview

This simulator reimagines the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe in an environmental context:
- **Player (X)**: Represents a conservationist taking actions like habitat restoration.
- **AI (O)**: Represents environmental threats like pollution or urbanization.
- **Goal**: Line up 3 conservation efforts on the 3x3 grid before the threats dominate.

Built with Python and includes a smart AI using the **Minimax algorithm**.
